  ## How to use it?
  When you first open up the project, make sure you change into the proper directory and npm i to install all of the necessary dependencies. Also, make sure that you have mongoDB downloaded to your computer or this project won't work. I used insomonia to test my api routes, but you can use whatever tool you'd prefer. Enter in the proper api route, and type in json that corresponds with the model and the CRUD opperation you are tring to preform. Take a look at your database to see all of the information you entered in stored!
